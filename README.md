# Student_management_system
The Student Management System has become an essential tool for educational institutions of all sizes, from small primary schools to large universities. In this tutorial, we’ll create such a Student Management System Project in Python using Tkinter and MySQL.

It will help to manage the following tasks:
Add new data of a student.
View the information of an existing student.
Update or modify a student’s data.
Delete the record of a student.

The project folder contains three Python files, main.py, custom.py, and credentials.py. As the name of main.py, it handles all the tasks. custom.py has information about the color and font used by the main program. credentials.py or the final file contains credentials to log in to the MySQL server. Here, users need to enter their own Username and Password for the MySQL server.
